        <h2>What Is Data Analysis?</h2>
        <p>Data analysis is the process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to derive meaningful insights and conclusions. It involves using various statistical and computational techniques to identify patterns, trends, and relationships within datasets. The goal of data analysis is to make informed decisions, solve problems, and gain a deeper understanding of the underlying information.</p>

                    <td>Descriptional analysis is the process of describing the basic features of the data in a study. It is a type of data analysis that involves organizing, tabulating, and summarizing data in an informative way. For example, creating a frequency distribution table or a bar chart to show the distribution of a variable.</td>

                    <td>Inferential Analysis</td>
                    <td>Inferential analysis is the process of making inferences or predictions about a population based on a sample of data. It involves using statistical methods to estimate parameters of the population and to test hypotheses about the data. For example, using a t-test to compare the means of two groups or using a regression model to predict a dependent variable based on one or more independent variables.</td>

                    <td>Predictive analysis is the process of using statistical models to predict future outcomes based on historical data. It involves using machine learning algorithms and data mining techniques to identify patterns and relationships in the data. For example, using a decision tree to predict whether a customer will churn or using a neural network to predict the stock price of a company in the future.</td>
