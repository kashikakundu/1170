README

The code includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. They’re well-organized to build a good website. Each HTML file has a different role in the website’s structure and content.
The About_me.html page introduces me, the creator. It talks about my interests, hobbies, and career goals. It also talks about my studies in Computer Science at Dalhousie University. There’s a form on the page where visitors can submit their information. The form uses JavaScript to make sure all fields are filled in correctly and that email addresses are from Dalhousie University.
The Data.html page is an educational resource about data analysis. It explains different types of data analysis and why they’re important in areas like business, healthcare, and research. The information is presented clearly using tables and lists.
The Education.html page talks about my education. It starts with my time at Delhi Public School, Gurgaon, and goes up to my current studies at Dalhousie University. The page uses images and videos to show my educational experiences. It also talks about the importance of learning by doing and how this has helped me develop my skills and passion for technology and computer science.
The style.css file defines the website’s visual style. It uses CSS to control the layout, fonts, colors, and other visual elements. This makes the website look consistent and enhances the user experience.
The script.js file adds dynamic features to the website. It uses JavaScript to validate forms, change color schemes, and display notifications. This makes the website more engaging and easier to navigate.
In conclusion, the combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in this code creates a compelling digital experience. The website is more than just a source of information. It’s a vibrant reflection of my journey, my passion for data analysis, and my commitment to academic excellence and personal growth.
