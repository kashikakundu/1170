        <h2>UNIVERSITY:</h2>
        <p  id="uni">When I finished high school and started university, I went to Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. I decided to study Computer Science there. The university had a great atmosphere for learning. Being in my first year, I learned about important computer science topics like programming languages, data structures, and algorithms. At Dalhousie University, the professors were really knowledgeable about computer science. They patiently taught me all the tricky stuff. I learned a lot from their lectures, labs, and hands-on projects. It helped me understand both the theory and how to use computer science in real life.When I started at Dalhousie University, I was studying Computer Science. In my first year, I learned that computer science is all about working together and creating new things. Itâ€™s really exciting because there are so many possibilities for the future. I was really curious and ready to learn more. I was looking forward to all the challenges and adventures that were coming my way. I hope to have participate in many events and challenges to experience and face different paths.</p>
